<h1>Budget Bite</h1>
A generative AI-based meal planning and budgeting system that allows college students to plan and eat nutritious, budget-friendly meals. 


<h2>Why Budget Bite?</h2>

College life is a whirlwind of activity, with students juggling academic responsibilities, extracurriculars, part-time jobs, and social commitments. In the midst of this chaos, maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet often takes a backseat. Rising inflation costs further exacerbate the challenge, forcing many students to prioritize rent and bills over wholesome meals. Recognizing these struggles, our team embarked on a mission to develop an innovative solution that addresses the nutritional needs of college students while accommodating their busy lifestyles.

With Budget Bite, students can use our one-stop application to prioritize their health and budget without compromising on either. Whether you're scrambling to make a meal with limited ingredients or looking for budget-friendly recipes that won't compromise on taste or nutrition, Budget Bite has you covered.


<h2>Our Solution</h2>

Budget Bite is a comprehensive meal planning system that allows users full customization to create a menu for their week that caters to their needs. 

Saving money and eating well are the main tenets of our application, and to facilitate this, our application offers the opportunity to generate a recipe using your preexisting ingredients right at the top of the page. Users can even upload an image of their fridge or pantry to further expedite that process. 

The main page also offers a few popular recipes along with a vibrant visual depiction to go with each of them.

On the Budgeted Meal Plan page, users can input their daily budget, diet type, and food restrictions to generate a meal plan for a day, 3 days, or a week, which will include a full recipe for breakfast lunch and dinner along with the nutritional facts and an accompanying image. 

For students that are in the mood to be a little more creative and have the time and resources to experiment, we have a page of recipes that are dorm-kitchen friendly, and another page with more advanced recipes for students who have access to a real sized kitchen. 

Our goal is to make healthy eating accesible and simple, and our Food Bank Locator allows users to input a local zipcode in order to find their nearest food bank. 

Finally, education is the first step to making healthy changes stick, and the Learn page allows users to explore nutrition and diet under the guidance of the generative AI.
